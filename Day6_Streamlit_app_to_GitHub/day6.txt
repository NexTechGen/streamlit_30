Uploading your Streamlit app to GitHub

GitHub
Git is a software for keeping track of all changes made to code (i.e. version control). GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that makes data and code publicly available on the web, which allows team collaboration and allow others to contribute to the repo.

Housing your Streamlit app in a GitHub repository will allow apps to be deployed to the cloud (the next challenge).
